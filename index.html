                The earliest known beer produced using barley dates as far back as 5000 B.C. in ancient Mesopotamia, 
                what is today modern Iran, confirmed through chemical analysis. Beer, in fact, is one of the oldest domesticated
                products in human history. The ability to produce bread and cereal leads to the natural occurance of spontaneous
                fermentation from wild yeasts in the air. It seems beer was destined for humanity!

                Beer Through History
              </h3>
              <p>
                For most of recorded human history, beer was produced and sold on a largely domestic scale, from local brewers to
                local buyers. It was not until the turn of the millenium A.D. that beer began to be produced on a larger scale with
                European monasteries; still, the production of beer was largerly reserved as an artisanal craft, and this would not
                change until the onset of the industrial revolution. Until then however, it was left to the brewers... artists in
                their craft.

                Throughout the 2nd millenium A.D. the practice of brewing became less local and more mass produced, but the process
                became more sacred in some ways. Certain brewing practices became a standard of the process, while others were called out for not
                being true beers. In Germany, the Reinheitsgebot were introcuded as a purity law stating that beer could only consist of water,
                barley, hops, and yeast. While the use of hops was invented and adopted in Germany, in Englad the use of hops was outlawed
                as not a true ingredient in beer. In Asia, the practice of using cooked rice to ferment beer was seen as an anomaly
                that left the finished product not being classified as beer at all, to this day retaining a different name often called
                sake, which is simply the Chinese/Japanese name for all alcoholoic beverages. These artisan idiosyncrasies however would
                not hold beer back from the industrial revolution...

                The onset of the industrial revolution allowed for a tremendous increase in productivity and efficiency in all industires and
                this was no different for beer, the invention of the thermometer and hydrometer in particular were of significant use in the
                innovation of beer production. Also prior to the 18th century was the process of creating malt from mostly wood, charcoal, or
                straw flames that left the finished beer with a significant smokey falvor brewers historically tried hard to get rid of; for 
                many this reportedly made beer taste undrinkable and the smoky quality treated with near universal revulsion! The scientific
                study of fermentation led to brewers being able to control the souring of beer by microorganisms, meanwhile, the use of brown
                bottles for beer became standard as it became understood that the brown color helped prevent breakdown of the beer from harmful
                rays.
