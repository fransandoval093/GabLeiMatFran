                Let There Be Beer!

              <p>
                The earliest known beer produced using barley dates as far back as 5000 B.C. in ancient Mesopotamia, 
                what is today modern Iran, confirmed through chemical analysis. Beer, in fact, is one of the oldest domesticated
                products in human history. The ability to produce bread and cereal leads to the natural occurence of spontaneous
                fermentation from wild yeasts in the air. It seems beer was destined for humanity!

                Beer Through History
              </h3>
              <p>
                For most of recorded human history, beer was produced and sold on a largely domestic scale, from local brewers to
                local buyers. It was not until the turn of the millennium A.D. that beer began to be produced on a larger scale with
                European monasteries; still, the production of beer was largely reserved as an artisanal craft, and this would not
                change until the onset of the industrial revolution. Until then however, it was left to the brewers... artists in
                their craft.

                Throughout the 2nd millennium A.D. the practice of brewing became less local and more mass produced, but the process
                became more sacred in some ways. Certain brewing practices became a standard of the process, while others were called out for not
                being true beers. In Germany, the Reinheitsgebot were introduced as a purity law stating that beer could only consist of water,
                barley, hops, and yeast. While the use of hops was invented and adopted in Germany, in England the use of hops was outlawed
                as not a true ingredient in beer. In Asia, the practice of using cooked rice to ferment beer was seen as an anomaly
                that left the finished product not being classified as beer at all, to this day retaining a different name often called
                sake, which is simply the Chinese/Japanese name for all alcoholic beverages. These artisan idiosyncrasies however would
                not hold beer back from the industrial revolution...

                Industrialization

              <p>
                The onset of the industrial revolution allowed for a tremendous increase in productivity and efficiency in all industries and
                this was no different for beer, the invention of the thermometer and hydrometer in particular were of significant use in the
                innovation of beer production. Also prior to the 18th century was the process of creating malt from mostly wood, charcoal, or
                straw flames that left the finished beer with a significant smokey flavor brewers historically tried hard to get rid of; for 
                many this reportedly made beer taste undrinkable and the smoky quality treated with near universal revulsion! The scientific
                study of fermentation led to brewers being able to control the souring of beer by microorganisms, meanwhile, the use of brown
                bottles for beer became standard as it became understood that the brown color helped prevent breakdown of the beer from harmful
                rays.

              <p>
                As the landscape of production for beer changed so too did the landscape of producers of beer. The evolution of brewing from a
                family or artisanal craft to a more mass produced product was a slow change through milleniums of human history, but as with
                many other products this changed rapidly and drastically with the Industrial Revolution. Beer became increasingly produced by
                larger companies that often started as small local breweries and these companies consolidated more of the market for beer over
                time; something exhasterbated by prohibition in the United States where beer was outlawed for over a decade! This change came 
                at the detriment of beer quality, with most brew masters agreeing that the loss of traditional brewing techniques to more mass 
                production efficient techniques caused a significant decrease in the quality of the product. However, not all is lost! In more
                recent years the art of brewing has picked up once more and there is a widespread eagerness to return to the artisnal craft of
                brewing, something we hope you find and explore on our website. CHEERS!
